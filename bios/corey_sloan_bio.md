## Project Interests:
I am interested in most kinds of Senior Design project. I would specifically enjoy a project that involved low level coding projects. This could include fiddling with hardware, developing C frameworks, etc. I am also invested in doing some AI work where we are handling a custom dataset and doing some reinforcement learning. 

## Potential Projects

### Custom Drone w/ Infared sensing
This would involved teaching a drone to traverse an area using infared signals from the drone rather than a standard camera. This would be interesting to see the effectiveness in close quarter areas and develop smaller drones by reducing weight of sensors. 

### Update KDE Connect Messaging w/ RCS
KDE Connect is an opensource project developed by the KDE Community. They have a KDE conncect that allows an android phone to communicate and control a linux distro. The current messaging application does not support RCS. 

### Potential Hobart Object recognition project
Hobart develops scales and has a 3rd party vendor they pay to handle their object recognitiion. I have been informed that they may be interested in handling this on their own. this would require developing a model that interacts with their database to fetch product information. 

### Sponsored Company projects
I am also open to working on either of the Siemens or GE projects.
